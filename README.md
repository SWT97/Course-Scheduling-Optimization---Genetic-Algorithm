# Course-Scheduling-Optimization---Genetic-Algorithm
Using genetic algorithm (GA) vs particle swarm optimization for course scheduling

Constraints include:
1. Course scheduling of year 2025 for 2 master programme, which is SE and DSBA
2. Only 5 intakes while the maximum modules offered per intake is limited to 4 modules per intake.
3. A module cannot be schedule in consecutive intake
4. Modules that offer across both programme must scheduled concurrently
5. RMCE and RMCP must be schedule in intake Jan, May and Oct
